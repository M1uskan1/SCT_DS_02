Exploratory Data Analysis on the mental health of students due to mobile usage involves examining various aspects of data related to how mobile usage impacts their well-being.
Hereâ€™s a structured approach you can take:

1.Hypothesis: Increased mobile usage correlates with higher levels of stress, anxiety, and reduced academic performance.
2. Data Collection
Sources: Surveys, questionnaires, or existing datasets on student mental health and mobile usage.
Variables:
Independent: Time spent on mobile, types of mobile activities (social media, gaming, etc.).
Dependent: Stress levels, anxiety scores, academic performance.
3. Data Cleaning
Outlier Detection: Identify and decide whether to remove outliers based on domain knowledge.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Compute mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation for relevant variables.
Data Visualization: Used bar graphs to depict the relationships between the different variables.
5. Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients between variables (e.g., mobile usage and stress levels).
Group Comparisons: Compare mental health metrics between different groups based on mobile usage patterns (e.g., heavy users vs. light users).
Trend Analysis: Look for trends over time or across different demographic groups.
6. Interpretation and Conclusion
Interpret Findings: Discuss key findings such as significant correlations or patterns observed.
Limitations: Address any limitations in the data or analysis (e.g., sample size, survey biases).
Conclusion: Summarize whether the data supports the hypothesis and implications for further research or interventions.
7. Reporting
Visualizations: Include relevant charts and graphs in your report to illustrate findings effectively.
